          <b>I currently work in Nashville for Ramsey Solutions as a test engineer and previously worked as a software engineer in Indianapolis.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been working in the technology sector for over four years and have loved every minute of it!
          Learning new technologies and systems is a passion of mine. So, if you need help with a project,
          then I will be happy to help.

          When attending University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, AR, I wanted to become a doctor.
          I loved the problem solving and fast-paced environment of the medical field and thought it
          was the only field that would allow me to work in that kind of environment. This led me to 
          complete my Bachelor's of Science in Biology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Half-way through my undergraduate degree, I found computer science and coding. I immediately knew it 
          was the right path for me and I pursued a minor in computer science. Since then, I have never looked back 
          and am very passionate about the software field and try to learn more about it every chance I get.
